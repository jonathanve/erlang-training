OTP
---

OTP apps usually consist of a gen_server supervised by a gen_supervisor
together with some error logging code.

Looks really nice and clean.

Behaviours:

application      contains app file which describes the otp app
gen_server       basic fault tolerant server
gen_supervisor   used to (re)start a gen server when errors
gen_event        generate alarms and handle events
gen_fsm          finite state machines (useful for parsers)
